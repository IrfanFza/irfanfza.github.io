		<h1>What Is Technology?</h1>
		<p>It is everything that we can use to better ourselves. The ability to connect with people instantly, to improve the lives of those with disabilities, to automate processes, and to discover new ways of doing old things. It is the project of our innovation, and changes depending upon the era.</p>
		<p>What we currently think of as technology would be science fiction in the past, and what we think of as merely useful tools would be seen as amazing technology going back in history.</p>
		<p>In summation, it is everything that humans have created and will continue to create to make advancements for the species as a whole.</p>

		<h2>Who I am?</h2>

		<p>I grew up in a working class neighbourhood. I am currently in a relationship with Isabel Lorraine Bryant. Isabel is 2 years younger than me and works as a lawyer.</p>
